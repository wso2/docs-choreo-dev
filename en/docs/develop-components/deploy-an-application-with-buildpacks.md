# Deploy an Application with Buildpacks

Using Choreo, you can easily deploy applications written in different language frameworks (such as Java, Go, NodeJS, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.) on shared or private data planes.

Choreo supports deploying applications with buildpacks for the following component types:

- Service
- Web Application
- Scheduled Task
- Manual Task
- Webhook
- Event Handler
- Test Runner

## Buildpacks
Buildpacks are a fundamental building block in modern application development. They convert your source code into a secure, efficient, production-ready container image without a Dockerfile. With Choreo, developers can take advantage of this powerful tool to effortlessly deploy their applications without the hassle of manual configuration.

Choreo uses [Google Buildpacks](https://cloud.google.com/docs/buildpacks/overview) as default buildpacks for Java, Go, NodeJS, Python, PHP, and Ruby. Choreo uses its own buildpacks for Ballerina and WSO2 MI.


## Develop a component

To develop a service component that exposes a REST API in Go. you can follow the [Develop a Go REST API ](develop-services/develop-a-go-rest-api.md) guide.

Follow the guidelines below based on your language:

=== "Python"
    Supported Versions - 3.10.x, 3.11.x

    Refer below examples for different component types. Follow the `readme.md` inside the example.

    | Component Type  | Example            |
    |---------------- |--------------------|
    | Service| [Reading Books List Service](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/reading-books-list-service-python)|
    | Manual Task | [Hello World Task](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/hello-world-python-task)|

    ### Procfile
    A `Procfile` is a configuration file used to declare the commands that are run by your application's containers. 
    
    !!! info 
        In **Python** projects, it is mandatory to have a `Procfile` with the `web` process type in the project root directory.

    Here's an example `Procfile` for an application:

    ```
    web: <command to start your application>
    ```

    Eg:-

    `web: python main.py` <br>
    `web: gunicorn --bind :8080 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app` <br>
    `web: flask run --host=0.0.0.0`

    For more examples, see [Choreo samples](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples).

    !!! info

         When working on Java projects:

           - The `Main` class should be defined in the manifest file.
           - If Maven files such as `mvn.cmd` exist in the project without the `.mvn` directory, the build will fail. To ensure a successful build, you must either commit the `.mvn` directory along with any Maven files or not include any Maven files in the project if you choose not to commit the `.mvn` directory.
    
    #### Procfile 

    A `Procfile` is a configuration file used to declare the commands that are run by your application's containers. 
    If you want to customize the default entry point of the container, you can include a `Procfile` with the `web` process type in the project root directory. 
    In **Java** projects, it is optional to include a `Procfile`.

    Here's an example `Procfile` for an application:
