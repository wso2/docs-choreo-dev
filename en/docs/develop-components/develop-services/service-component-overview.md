# Service Component Overview

Explore how to create, deploy, manage, and observe service components in Choreo.

## What is a service component?

A service component in Choreo lets you deploy and expose REST, GraphQL, gRPC, UDP, or TCP services. It is a fundamental building block for creating cloud-native applications in Choreo. They provide a simple and effective way to expose functionality as a service to other components within Choreo or to the outside world.

Service components encapsulate business logic and provide standardized interfaces, called endpoints, for communicating with other components or systems. You can deploy and scale services independently, which makes them highly flexible and adaptable to changing workloads.

With the help of the service component, developers can quickly create APIs and microservices, making it easier to implement and manage complex software systems. Service components can also be integrated with other Choreo components, that acts as message processors, connectors, and data sources, etc to create powerful end-to-end solutions.
