# Manage Component Source Configurations

In Choreo, you can configure service endpoints and connections via the `component.yaml` source configuration file. This file ensures that the configurations required to initialize endpoints and connections are defined, as they cannot be inferred from the source code. This guide provides an overview of how to configure and manage these settings effectively.

The source configuration file must be committed to your repository within the `.choreo` directory at the root of the project directory. This ensures the ability to version the configuration files alongside repository commits, enabling better tracking and management of configurations.

!!! note
    -  The `component-config.yaml` and `endpoints.yaml` files will eventually be deprecated and replaced by the `component.yaml` file. 
        - For details on how you can migrate to the `component.yaml` file from the `component-config.yaml` file, see [Migrate from the `component-config.yaml`](#migrate-from-the-component-configyaml-file).
        - For details on how you can migrate to the `component.yaml` file from the `endpoints.yaml` file, see [Migrate from the `endpoints.yaml`](#migrate-from-the-endpointsyaml-file).
    - Choreo prioritizes configuration files in the following order: `component.yaml` takes the highest precedence, followed by `component-config.yaml`, and then `endpoints.yaml`.

## Overview of the `component.yaml` file 

**File location**:

```bash
<build-context-path>/.choreo/component.yaml
```

!!! note
    - For components built using **Buildpacks**, replace `build-context-path` with the `<project-directory>`. 
    For example, `<project-directory>/.choreo/component.yaml`.
    - For components built using **Docker**, replace `build-context-path` with the `<docker-context-path>`. 
    For example, `<docker-context-path>/.choreo/component.yaml`.

    ```

    The descriptor-based approach of the `component.yaml` file simplifies and streamlines endpoint and connection configuration management. The use of versioned schemas ensures backward compatibility, providing a seamless transition with future updates.

    You can define the following root-level configurations via the `component.yaml` file:

    | Configuration        | Required     | Description                                                              |
    |----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **schemaVersion**    | Required     | The version of the `component.yaml` file. Defaults to the latest version.|
    | **endpoints**        | Optional     | The list of endpoint configurations.                                     |
    | **dependencies**     | Optional     | The list of dependency configurations.                                   |

    ### Endpoint configurations
    In the `endpoints` section of the `component.yaml` file, you can define multiple service endpoint configurations. Each endpoint must have a unique name and the required fields specified in the schema overview.

    !!! tip "Why have a unique name?"
          When you define multiple endpoints, the `endpoint.name` is appended to the Choreo-generated URL. A unique name ensures the endpoint is easily recognizable and readable within the URL.
          
    | Configuration        | Required     | Description                                                                                             |
    |----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **name**             | Required     | A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component. Avoid using excessively long names.  |
    | **displayName**      | Optional     | A display name for the endpoint.                                                                        |
    | **service**          | Required     | Service details for the endpoint.                                                                       |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**.basePath** | Required     | The base path of the API exposed via this endpoint.                        |
    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**.port**     | Required     | The numeric port value exposed via this endpoint.                          |
    | **type**             | Required     | The type of traffic the endpoint accepts. For example, `REST`, `GraphQL`, `WS`, `gRPC`, `UDP`, or `TCP`.|
    | **networkVisibilities** | Required | The network-level visibility of the endpoint. For example, project, organization, or public.                    |
    | **schemaFilePath** | Required | The file path to the swagger definition  or AsyncAPI 2.0 specification file. Defaults to the wildcard route if not specified. This field should be a relative path to the project path when using **Java**, **Python**, **NodeJS**, **Go**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, or **WSO2 MI** buildpacks. For REST or WebSocket endpoint types, when using the **Ballerina** or **Dockerfile** buildpack, the path should be relative to the component root or Docker context. |

    ### Dependency configurations

    In the `dependencies` section of the `component.yaml` file, you can define multiple connection configurations under `dependencies.connectionReferences`. You can use the connection reference generated in the in-line developer guide when creating a connection. For instructions on copying [connection configurations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-service/), see the in-line developer guide displayed during connection creation.

    You must include the following configurations in the `dependencies.connectionReferences` schema:

    | Configuration        | Required     | Description                                                                      |
    |----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **name**             | Required     | The name given to the connection.                                                |
    | **resourceRef**      | Required     | A unique, human-readable identifier for the service you are connecting.          |


    !!! note
        Choreo automatically generates connection configurations when you create a connection. The properties such as **name** and **resourceRef** are automatically generated. The configurations required to establish the connection will be injected into Choreo-defined environment variables.

        To use custom environment variable names instead of Choreo's default ones, add the dependency as a `serviceReference` in your `component.yaml v1.1` file. You can copy the `serviceReference` section from the `component.yaml v1.0` tab and paste it under `dependencies` in your `component.yaml v1.1` file, which maintains backward compatibility with the v1.0 format.

=== "Version 1.0"

    ``` yaml
    # +required The configuration file schema version
    schemaVersion: 1.0

              - from: ServiceURL
                # +required Environment variable injected into the container.
                to: SERVICE_URL
    ```

The `component-config.yaml` file complements and enhances the existing endpoint configuration process. It allows you to define how the endpoints (inbound connections) in your service are exposed and how your service connects to external services or components (outbound connections).

You can define the following root-level configurations via the `component-config.yaml` file:

| Configuration        | Required     | Description                                                                           |
|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **apiVersion**       | Required     | The version of the `component-config.yaml` file defaults to `core.choreo.dev/v1beta1`.|
| **kind**             | Required     | The resource type of the file defaults to `ComponentConfig`.                          |
| **spec.inbound**     | Optional     | The list of inbound connection configurations.                                        |
| **spec.outbound**    | Optional     | The list of outbound connection configurations.                                       |

#### Inbound connection configurations (`spec.inbound`)

In the `spec.inbound` configuration section, you can specify endpoints to set up inbound connections. To specify endpoints, you can follow the existing endpoints schema structure. For details on the endpoints schema structure, see the [endpoints schema documentation](#overview-of-the-endpointsyaml-file).

#### Outbound connection configurations (`spec.outbound`)

In the `spec.outbound` section, you can define `serviceReferences`. To define `serviceReferences`, you can use the service references generated in the Internal Marketplace when creating a service connection. To copy the [outbound connection configurations](../sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-service/#use-a-connection-in-your-service), see the inline developer guide displayed when you create a connection.

You must include the following configurations in the `serviceReferences` schema:

| Configuration        | Required     | Description                                                                      |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **env**              | Optional     | The list of environment variable mappings to inject into the container.          |
| **env.from**         | Required     | The key name of the connection configuration.                                    |
| **env.to**           | Required     | The environment variable to inject into the container.                           |

## Overview of the `endpoints.yaml` file

**File location**:

```bash
<build-context-path>/.choreo/endpoints.yaml
```

**Sample `endpoints.yaml` file content**:

```yaml
# +required Version of the endpoint configuration YAML

  context: /greeting
  # +optional Path to the schema definition file. Defaults to wild card route if not provided
  # This is only applicable to REST and WS endpoint types.
  # The path should be relative to the docker context.
  schemaFilePath: greeting_openapi.yaml
```

The `endpoints.yaml` configuration file allows you to define configurations for multiple endpoints necessary for Choreo service components. This schema is essential to identify the context, port binding, network exposure level, and other attributes required to generate a Choreo endpoint.

You can define the following root-level configurations via the `endpoints.yaml` file:

| Configuration        | Required     | Description                                                                      |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **version**          | Required     | The version of the `endpoints.yaml` file.                                           |
| **name**             | Required     | A unique name for the endpoint, which Choreo will use to generate the managed API.|
| **port**             | Required     | The numeric port value that gets exposed via this endpoint.                      |
| **type**             | Required     | The type of traffic this endpoint accepts, such as `REST`, `GraphQL`, `gRPC`, `WS`, `UDP`, or `TCP`. Currently, the MI preset supports only the `REST` type.                                         |
| **networkVisibility**| Required     | The network level visibility of this endpoint, which defaults to `Public` if not specified. Accepted values are `Project`, `Organization`, or `Public`.|
| **context**          | Required     | The context (base path) of the API that Choreo exposes via this endpoint.        |
| **schemaFilePath**   | Required     | The swagger definition file path. Defaults to the wildcard route if not provided. This field should be a relative path to the project path when using the **Java**, **Python**, **NodeJS**, **Go**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, and **WSO2 MI** buildpacks. For REST endpoint types, when using the **Ballerina** or **Dockerfile** buildpack, this field should be a relative path to the component root or Docker context.|

## Migration guide

With the upcoming deprecation of the `component-config.yaml` file and the `endpoints.yaml` file, Choreo provides a seamless migration path to the `component.yaml` file. See the following guidelines for details depending on the configuration you want to migrate from:

### Migrate from the `component-config.yaml` file

To migrate from the `component-config.yaml` file to the `component.yaml` file, do the following:

- Add the `schemaVersion` in the `component.yaml` and omit `apiVersion` and `kind`.
- Move endpoint configurations from the `spec.inbound` section to the `endpoints` section in the `component.yaml` file.
    - Copy the value of `spec.inbound.context` to `endpoints.service.basePath`.
    - Copy the value of `spec.inbound.port` to `endpoints.service.port`.
    - Copy the value of `spec.inbound.networkVisibility` to `endpoints.networkVisibilities`.

- Move dependency configurations from the `spec.outbound` section to the `dependencies` section in the `component.yaml` file. 

### Migrate from the `endpoints.yaml` file

To migrate from the `endpoints.yaml` file to the `component.yaml` file, do the following:

- Add the `schemaVersion` in the `component.yaml` and omit `version`.
- Move endpoint configurations from the `endpoints.yaml` file to the `endpoints` section in the `component.yaml` file.
    - Copy the value of `context` to `endpoints.service.basePath`.
    - Copy the value of `port` to `endpoints.service.port`.
    - Copy the value of `networkVisibility` to `endpoints.networkVisibilities`.
