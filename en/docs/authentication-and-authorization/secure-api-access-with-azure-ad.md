# Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

API security refers to the measures and practices used to protect Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) from potential threats and vulnerabilities. Authentication and authorization are key aspects of API security. Authentication is ensuring that only authorized users or applications can access the API. This can involve using API keys, tokens, or more advanced authentication methods like OAuth 2.0. Authorization is controlling what authenticated users or applications are allowed to do within the API. Authorization mechanisms restrict access to specific resources and actions based on user roles or permissions. 

Organizations using Microsoft Azure AD for identity and access management (IAM) can seamlessly integrate it with Choreo as an external Identity Provider (IdP). This guide will walk you through setting up Choreo to authenticate API invocations through Azure AD which is configured as an external IdP.

This guide walks you through the following steps:

- Assign scopes to an API in Choreo. 
- Create an API in Azure AD.
- Create an application in Azure AD and consume the Azure API.
- Create an application in Choreo and enable external IdP authentication.
- Invoke the API with scopes.

## Prerequisites

Before you try out this guide, complete the following:

-  [Configured Azure AD as an external IdP](../administer/configure-an-external-idp/configure-azure-ad-as-an-external-idp.md). 
-  If you don't already have an API in Choreo, [develop a REST API](../develop-components/develop-services/develop-a-rest-api.md) or a [REST API Proxy](../develop-components/develop-a-rest-api-proxy.md) and deploy it. 
- **An Azure Active Directory account**:  If you donâ€™t already have one, set up an Azure Active Directory account at [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).
- **Administrator rights to your Choreo organization**: You need this to configure the Azure AD account in your organization.
- To create applications, the `Application Developer` role is required. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-developer)


## Step 1: Assign scopes to an API in Choreo

To provide fine-grained access control to resources, we use scopes. Follow the steps below to assign a scope to the resources in the API:

1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component you want to attach scopes to.
2. On the left navigation, click **Manage** and then **Permissions**.
3. Click **+ Add Permission (Scope)**. 
4. On the **Permission List** pane, enter the permission value and click **+ Add New**.
5. Click the copy icon in front of the added scope to copy the fully qualified name of the scope. Save this value for future reference. 
5. To attach a scope to a resource, click the **Select Permissions** list under the respective resource, and select the scopes you wish to attach.
6. Click **Save and Deploy**.
7. On the left navigation, click **Manage** and then **Lifecycle**.
8. Click **Publish** and continue to publish your API to the Choreo Developer Portal. 

## Step 2: Create a web API on Azure AD

To enable external IdP authentication for APIs,  create an API on Azure AD that represents the API on Choreo. Follow the steps below: 

1. Sign in to the Azure console.
2. Follow the [Azure guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application) to create a Web API that represents your API on Choreo.
3. On the left navigation, under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**.
4. Add the default **Application ID URI** and click **Save and Continue**.
4. Under **Scopes defined by this API**, select **Add a scope**.
5. Enter the fully qualified name as the **scope name**. 
6. Define who can consent. You can alternatively [add a scope requiring admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#add-a-scope-requiring-admin-consent).
7. Enter appropriate values and click **Add Scope**.

For more information, refer to the Azure documentation: 
- [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Quickstart: Configure an application to expose a web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis)

### Step 2.1: Assign users to the web API

You can restrict users to the API as follows: 

1. Go to your Azure AD main menu. 
2. Under **Manage**,  click on **Enterprise Applications**. Alternatively, on Microsoft Entra, under **Applications**, click **Enterprise Applications**.
3. Select your API. 
4. Under **Manage**, select the **Users and groups** then select **+ Add user/group**.
5. Select the users and groups and click **Select**.

For more information, refer to the Azure documentation: [Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access](Assign the app to users and groups to restrict access)

## Step 3: Create a client application on Azure AD and invoke the Azure web API

To expose the API to application developers, create an application in Azure AD. This application provides you with a client-id and client-secret that your application needs to use to invoke the API. 

### Step 3.1: Create a client application

Follow the steps below to create the application:

1. Follow the steps in [Register an application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application) on Azure to create an application.
2. [Configure the platform settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#configure-platform-settings). Enter your client application's redirect URI in the process. 

    !!! note
         OAuth2 Authorization Grant flow applies to Web Applications.
     
### Step 3.1: Consume the Azure AD web API from the Azure AD application

Once you create the application, select the API and the scopes you want the application to consume. Follow the steps below:

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** and then click **App registrations**.
2. Select your client application (not your web API).
3. On the left navigation, click **API permissions**.
4. Click  **+ Add a permission**  and select **My APIs**.
5. Select the API and the required scopes and click **Add Permissions**.

For more information, refer to the Azure documentation: [Add permissions to access your web API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis)


### Step 3.2: Create secrets for the Azure web application

To invoke the application, provide client secrets to the consuming application. Follow the steps below to generate the credentials:

1. On the left navigation, click **Certificates & Secrets**.
2. Click **+ New client secret**.
2. Provide a meaningful description and the required expiration. 
3. Click **Add**.
4. Copy the created `Secret ID` and `Value` for future reference. 
5. On the left navigation, click **Overview** and open the overview page of the API. 
6. Copy the `Application (client) ID` and save it for future reference.

For more information, refer to the Azure documentation: [Add a Client Secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)

## Step 4: Create an application in Choreo and enable external IdP authentication.

Follow the steps below to consume the Choreo API and use an external IdP for authentication:

1. Sign in to the Choreo Developer Portal at [https://devportal.choreo.dev](https://devportal.choreo.dev).
2. Click **Applications**. and then click **+Create**.
3. Enter a name and description for the application. 
4. Click **Create**.
5. On the left navigation, under **Credentials** and click **Production**.
6. Select your AzureAD (Microsoft) configuration as the **Identity Provider**.
7. Enter the `Application (client) ID` you copied in at Step 3.2 as the **Client ID**.
8. Click **+Add**.

    !!! note 
        - You can only use the Client ID in one application.]
        - The Identity Provider dropdown is visible only to organizations where you have configured external IdPs. 

9. In the left navigation menu, click **Subscriptions**.
10. In the **Subscription Management** pane that opens, click **+ Add APIs**.
11. Select the API you assigned scopes to in step 1 and click **Add**. 

## Step 5: Invoke the API with scopes

You can now invoke the Choreo API using the authorization code grant. Choreo will authenticate the user with Azure AD and provide access to the resource. 

1. On the Choreo Developer Portal, go to your application.
2. On the left navigation, under **Credentials** and click **Production**.
3. Under **Endpoints**, copy the **Authorize Endpoint** URL.  
4. Invoke the authorization endpoint as follows: 

    === "Format"
    ```bash
    {authorize_url}?client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_url}&scope={scopes}&response_mode=query&response_type=code
    ```

    === "Example"
    ```bash
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/dd912d48-b0be-401f-b18c-8ca89e9c0b6c/oauth2/authorize?client_id=5eb1de74-e449-4973-a620-52c4dc9157a9&redirect_uri=https://localhost:9000&scope=api://580b40b7-5513-4714-a4e0-8d4e784f7dc6/urn:taylordean:books:books_addt&response_mode=query&response_type=code
    ```
7. Review the consent in the login screens that prompt and continue. 
8. After you log in, you will receive an authorization code in the URL. Copy the authorization code and use it to get an access token from Azure AD by following the next steps. 
10. On the Choreo Developer Portal, go to your application.
11. On the left navigation, under **Credentials** and click **Production**.
12. Under **Endpoints**, copy the **Token Endpoint** URL. 
13. Invoke the token endpoint as follows: 

    === "Format"
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    {token_endpoint} \
    -d 'client_id={client_id}' \
    -d 'scope={scopes}' \
    -d 'code={authorization_code}' \
    -d 'redirect_uri={redirect_url}' \
    -d 'client_secret={The client_secret value you copied from the Azure Application}'
    -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \    
    ```

    === "Example"
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/dd912d48-b0be-401f-b18c-8ca89e9c0b6c/oauth2/v2.0/token \
    -d 'client_id=5eb1de74-e449-4973-a620-52c4dc9157a9' \
    -d 'scope=api://580b40b7-5513-4714-a4e0-8d4e784f7dc6/urn:taylordean:books:books_add' \
    -d 'code=0.AXAASCâ€¦zZUzKYm18yM_5-SXz1uvRbbGYF7F32hE9zIQFRQY35haD' \
    -d 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:9000' \
    -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
    -d 'state=111' \
    -d 'client_secret=l4Q8Q~4WKiRXYSQZly5E6Ess.fKf__U1yJR3IaMd'
    ```

14. Once you receive the access token, you can [test invoking the resource using the OpenAPI console](../testing/test-rest-endpoints-via-the-openapi-console.md) in Choreo by specifying the scope.
