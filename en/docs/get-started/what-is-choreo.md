# What is Choreo?

Today, with the growth of the global API ecosystem, APIs have become an essential part of modern engineering. Therefore, it has become necessary for organizations to participate in this global API supply chain by consuming and producing APIs. The adoption of cloud and microservices-based distributed architecture has also become increasingly significant, causing more and more organizations to rapidly evolve and look for innovative ways to build their digital business ecosystem.
