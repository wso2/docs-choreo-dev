# Configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as an External Identity Provider (IdP)

In organizations leveraging Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity and access management (IAM), integrating it with Choreo offers powerful API access control. This control hinges on the use of API scopes. That is, it enables the restriction of access to a designated group of users. This document guide you step-by-step to configure Azure AD as your external IdP.

## Prerequisites

Before you try out this guide, be sure you have the following:

- **An Azure Active Directory account**:  If you donâ€™t already have one,  setup an Azure Active Directory account at [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).
- **Administrator rights to your Choreo organization**: You need this to configure the Azure AD account in your organization.

## Add Azure Active Directory as IdP in Choreo

Follow the steps below to add Azure AD as an IdP in Choreo:

1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev).
2. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**.
3. In the **API Management** tab, under **Identity Providers**, click **+ Identity Provider**.
4. Select  **Microsoft Security** as the Identity Provider. 
5. Provide a name and a description for the IdP. 
6. To obtain the `Well-Known URL` of your Azure AD instance, on your Azure account, under **Azure Active Directory** go to **App registrations**, and then **Endpoints**. Copy the URI under`OpenID Connect metadata document`.
    
    !!! info
        - In azure, there are two versions of access tokens available. By default, the IDP applications you create use the v1 access token. Therefore, if you intend to use the v1 access token, when providing the `Well-Known URL`, omit the v2.0 path segment from the URL. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#token-formats)
        For example, convert `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`-> `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
        - If you intend to work with v2.0, then the IDP application's manifest should be changed as explained in the [access tokendocumentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#token-formats). 
        
7. Leave the **Apply to all environments** checkbox selected. However, if you want to restrict the use of the external IdP to a certain environment, you can select them from the **Environments** list.
8. Click **Next**.
