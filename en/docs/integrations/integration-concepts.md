# Integration Concepts
Before you start building integrations with Choreo, there are basic concepts that you need to understand. This section walks you through all the integration concepts you need to know. 
 
## Integration
Integration in Choreo is the process of connecting APIs, events, and streams to function as a single unit that can share information.

## Integration Template
An integration template in Choreo is a prebuilt sample designed to address a common integration requirement. Choreo provides a comprehensive set of integration templates for you to select and use depending on your requirement.

## Trigger
A trigger in Choreo is an event or an action that can cause a Choreo application to start executing.

Choreo supports the following trigger types:

 - **Schedule**: To trigger an application based on a schedule that you set.
 - **Manual**: To run and test an application manually.
 - **Calendar**: To trigger an application based on events in a Google Calendar.
 - **GitHub**: To trigger an application based on GitHub events and actions. Supported GitHub events and associated actions that can trigger a Choreo application are as follows:

     | Event                       | Action                 | Application Trigger                      |
