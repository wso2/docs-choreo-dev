# API Path

When you create a service, you need to configure an API to invoke it. This configuration includes the **Path** field where you enter the path to be used by the API to trigger the service as well as to pass path parameters to it.

![Path field](../assets/img/references/path/path-field.png){.cInlineImage-half}

e.g., Create a service named `myservice`.

Once you deploy the service, you receive a hostname as follows:

```
https://<USERNAME>.choreoapis.dev/myservice/<VERSION>
```

The URL that you need to invoke to trigger the service changes based on the relative path from the host that you specify in the **Path** field of the API configuration.

The relative path can be as follows:

## Empty path

If you do not specify a relative path from the host, invoking the hostname invokes the service.

e.g.,

| **Path**      | **URL to invoke the service**                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Not specified | `https://<USERNAME>.choreoapis.dev/myservice/<VERSION>` |

## Single path

If you provide a single path in this field, you need to append it to the hostname to invoke your service.

e.g.,

| **Path**  | **URL to invoke the service**                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/path1`  | `https://<USERNAME>.choreoapis.dev/myservice/<VERSION>/path1` |

## Multiple path strings

You could also provide multiple paths for this field. If you do so, you need to append them to the hostname to invoke your service.

e.g.,

| **Path**             | **URL to invoke the service**                                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/path1/path2/path3` | `https://<USERNAME>.choreoapis.dev/myservice/<VERSION>/path1/path2/path3` |

## Path parameters

If you specify a path parameter, it could be read from within your service. This allows you to read values provided within the path. The format to specify path parameters is `[]`.

e.g.,

| **Path**                    | **URL to invoke the service**                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/[int id]/[string branch]` | `https://<USERNAME>.choreoapis.dev/myservice/<VERSION>/01/Chicago` |

In this example, the path allows you to read the ID (in this example,`01`) and the branch (in this example, `Chicago`) from within your service.
