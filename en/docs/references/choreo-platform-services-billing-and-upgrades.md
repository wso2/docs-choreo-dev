# Choreo Platform Service Billing and Upgrades

Choreo bills the platform services you create, such as databases, caches, or Kafka services, as part of your existing subscription. The cost depends on the service plan and the usage of each resource. 

## Platform service billing information

- **Hourly billing**: Usage is billed based on the number of hours a resource is active. For example, if you create a database, cache, or Kafka service and remove it within the same month, you pay only for the hours it was active.
- **Fixed pricing**: Pricing is based on the selected service plan. Choreo does not charge extra for network bandwidth usage.

## Upgrade a service plan

If you want to upgrade the service plan of a platform service you have created, contact [Choreo support](mailto:choreo-support@wso2.com).
