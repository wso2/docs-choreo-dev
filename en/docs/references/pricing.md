# Pricing

## Introduction

Choreo is a Digital Platform as a Service that helps you develop integration solutions faster by reducing the coding effort with a low-code development platform. You can choose the appropriate payment plan based on your usage.

The pricing for your Choreo deployment is mainly determined based on the following:

- **The number of components**

    You can have up to five free components ((i.e., any combination of component types), and pay for each additional component.

- **Infrastructure cost**

    The infrastructure cost consists of the charges to Choreo by the cloud platform for vCPU, RAM, storage, ingress, egress, and network. Choreo provides $100 worth of infrastructure free of charge to each organization.

    If the infrastructure cost of an organization on the Free plan exceeds $100, Choreo will limit some of the services it provides to it (e.g., some components might be deactivated).

    If the infrastructure cost of an organization on the Pay As You Go plan exceeds $100, it can pay the additional infrastructure charges to the Choreo Sales Team.

    If the infrastructure cost of an organization on the Enterprise plan exceeds $100, it can pay the additional infrastructure charges to the Choreo Sales Team or directly to the cloud platform vendor.


## Plans

Choreo currently supports the following payment plans:

**Free**

You can enjoy the free tier with limitations and then move on to the Pay-As-You-Go model if you want to deploy over 5 components.

Choreo allocates up to a maximum of 2x vCPUs and 4 GB RAM infrastructure resources to your component workloads.

**Pay As You Go**

This plan requires you to pay $150 per component (except for the first five components) and pay for any additional infrastructure costs incurred (i.e., if the infrastructure cost is over $100). It does not require you to pay an annual fee. You can deploy up to 25 components (i.e., any combination of component types). 

If the number of components you need to deploy exceeds 25 or if your annual spend exceeds $50,000, we recommend that you change your pricing plan to Enterprise.

**Enterprise** 

This plan allows you to pay an annual subscription of $50,000 or more (as agreed) and deploy up to 50 components (i.e., any combination of component types). If you need to deploy over 50 components, you can renegotiate with Choreo to pay an agreed amount per additional component or revise the annual subscription.

The following table summarizes the cost of each plan:

 |                      | **Free**       | **Pay As You Go** | **Enterprise** |
