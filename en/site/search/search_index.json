Choreo has a predefined set of roles with permissions assigned to them. Learn more</li> <li> <p>Group : Group is a collection of users.

Therefore, the changes you make to the policy stubs should reflect in the <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file. For example, if the policy is applicable only on the request and response paths, you can remove the  @mediation:FaultFlow annotation from the policy. Then, you MUST also remove the choreo-apim-mediation-fault-flow keyword from the generated <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file. If you do not do so, the Ballerina compiler will show an error at compile time.</p> Publish as a private custom policy <p>Choreo supports publishing a policy as a private custom policy. Publishing a policy as a private custom policy makes the policy inaccessible outside of the organization. To publish a policy as a private custom policy, change the visibility to <code>private</code> prior to pushing the package to Ballerina Central as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Open the <code>Ballerina.toml</code> file of your policy. </li> <li> <p>Set the visibility to private by adding the configuration <code>visibility=\"private\"</code>. For example:</p> <pre><code>[package]\n   org = \"orgName\"\n   name = \"packageName\"\n   version = \"1.0.2\"\n   export = [\"packageName\"]\n   distribution = \"2201.5.5\"\n   keywords = [\"choreo-apim-mediation-policy\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-request-flow\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-response-flow\",\"choreo-apim-mediation-fault-flow\"]\n   visibility = \"private\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Package and publish your policy to Ballerina Central.     </p> </li> </ol> Best practices <p>When implementing a policy, it is essential to follow best practices to ensure efficiency and maintainability. Here are some recommended best practices to follow:</p> <ul> <li>Organize the source code within the default module of the package. Do not add any additional modules.</li> <li>A policy implementation can contain any combination of flows. A generated project contains stubs for all three flows: <code>Request</code>, <code>Response</code>, and <code>Fault</code>. You can remove any stub that you do not require. For example, when you create a policy that re-writes the resource paths, you can remove the <code>Response</code> and <code>fault</code> stubs. </li> <li>The HTTP request/response objects and context record parameters gets passed as references to the policy functions. Therefore, the changes you make to these values persist throughout the policy execution and are propagated to subsequent policies. This behavior allows the request and response objects to accumulate transformations applied by attached policies.</li> <li>Familiarize yourself with the different return types of policy flows. The following return types are unmodifiable:<ul> <li>http:Response - Returns an HTTP response when you terminate the mediation flow prematurely. For example,  in the in-flow sequence, the mediation sequence terminates before calling the backend. The mediation policy then sends an HTTP response to the client.</li> <li>false - Returns <code>false</code> if you want to terminate the mediation sequence with a predefined response (on the Choreo side).</li> <li>error - Returns an error if you want to terminate the mediation flow and transfer control to the fault flow. The fault flow would then construct an error response and send it to the client.</li> <li>() - Returns () to signal the successful completion of the policy. Once the proxy has completed executing the policy, it starts to execute the next policy in the sequence.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"api-management/api-policies/#step-3-publish-the-policy","title":"Step 3: Publish the policy","text":"<p>Once you implement a policy, you must publish it to Ballerina Central. </p> <p>When you attach a policy and deploy an API, Choreo pulls the necessary packages from Ballerina Central and bundles them into the mediation application under the hood.

It is a fundamental building block for creating cloud-native applications in Choreo. They provide a simple and effective way to expose functionality as a service to other components within Choreo or to the outside world.</p> <p>Service components encapsulate business logic and provide standardized interfaces, called endpoints, for communicating with other components or systems. You can deploy and scale services independently, which makes them highly flexible and adaptable to changing workloads.</p> <p>With the help of the service component, developers can quickly create APIs and microservices, making it easier to implement and manage complex software systems. Service components can also be integrated with other Choreo components, that acts as message processors, connectors, and data sources, etc to create powerful end-to-end solutions.</p> <p>Services and integrations are exposed to other services, integrations, or applications through endpoints. A service or an integration can expose multiple endpoints, each representing a unique entry point into the service. For example, a service may expose a REST API endpoint and a GraphQL endpoint, each providing different ways to interact with the service. Endpoints provide specific details for how the service or the integration can be consumed. For instance, the port number, protocol, and the schema such as open API specification (OAS) or GraphQL schema. By defining these details, endpoints make it possible for other services, integrations, and applications to discover and interact with the service in a standardized way.</p> <p>Choreo defines endpoints by combining port binding, protocol, endpoint name, network visibility, endpoint schema, and additional protocol-related fields. The following table describes each attribute of an endpoint.</p> Field Description Name A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component. Port The network port on which the endpoint is accessible. Type The endpoint protocol. Supported protocols: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, UDP, and TCP. Network Visibility Determines the level of visibility of an endpoint.

You must mount a file (for example, <code>config.js</code>) and add the following configuration into it. </p> <p>The following is a sample configuration:</p> <pre><code>     window.configs = {\napiUrl: '&lt;SERVICE_URL&gt;',\nconsumerKey: '&lt;CONSUMER_KEY&gt;',\nconsumerSecret: '&lt;CONSUMER_SECRET&gt;',\ntokenUrl: '&lt;TOKEN_URL&gt;',\n};\n</code></pre> <p>For other types of web applications, you must add the respective configuration into your application.</p> <p> Step 2: Read the configuration</p> <p>Once you have added the connection configuration, you can proceed to read the configuration from your application. The steps to read depend on the programming language you use.</p> <p>The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:</p> <pre><code>     const serviceURL = window?.configs?.apiUrl ? window.configs.apiUrl : \"/\";\n</code></pre> <p> Step 3: Acquire an OAuth 2.0 access token</p> <ul> <li> <p>For languages with OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, you must pass the OAuth 2.0-related configurations such as client id, client secret and so on, obtained when creating the connection to your HTTP client configuration. The HTTP client autonomously manages token retrieval and refreshing.</p> </li> <li> <p>For languages without OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, you must manually initiate a call to the token endpoint. This includes fetching the token and managing token expiration and refresh directly within your application code. The following is a sample curl command to obtain a token:</p> <pre><code>CONSUMER_KEY=\"your_consumer_key\"\nCONSUMER_SECRET=\"your_consumer_secret\"\nTOKEN_URL=\"your_token_url\"\n# Encode client credentials as Base64\nCLIENT_CREDENTIALS=$(echo -n \"$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET\" | base64)\ncurl -X POST $TOKEN_URL \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\\n-H \"Authorization: Basic $CLIENT_CREDENTIALS\" \\\n--data-urlencode \"grant_type=client_credentials\"\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> <p> Step 4: Invoke the service</p> <p>You can invoke the service as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For languages with OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, you can invoke the service in a straightforward manner. The HTTP client seamlessly manages OAuth 2.0 authentication without requiring additional intervention.</p> <p>As the service URL you can use the URL that you resolved in step 2 above. For sample requests and responses, see the API definition provided via the Choreo marketplace for the service.</p> </li> <li> <p>For languages without OAuth 2.0-aware HTTP clients, you can use the token obtained in step 3 above to make calls to the dependent service. Subsequently, add the obtained token to the HTTP authorization header with the bearer prefix.</p> <p>As the service URL you can use the URL that you resolved in step 2 above. For sample requests and responses, see the API definition of the service provided via the Choreo marketplace.</p> <p>The following is a sample code snippet in NodeJS:</p> <pre><code>    const response = await axios.get(serviceURL/{RESOURCE_PATH}, {\nheaders: {\n'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`\n}\n})\n</code></pre> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale-component-replicas/","title":"Autoscale Component Replicas","text":"<p>Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down in number based on resource consumption to ensure high availability.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans for private data plane organizations.
